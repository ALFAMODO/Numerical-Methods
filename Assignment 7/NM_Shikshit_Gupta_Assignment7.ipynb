    "#### Problem 1, Job Search\n",
    "You are spamming resumes to apply jobs. Each resume you send out has 1% chance of getting a job offer. You have sent 100 resumes. What's your chance to get at least one job offer?\n",

    "1. Please solve the problem by math. Use python mathematical expression to get the result.\n",
    "2. Analytic solution. Use pmf function to solve the problem.\n",
    "3. Answer by simulation. Use rvs function to simulate the process and estimate the answer.\n",
    "4. How many resumes in total do you have to spam so that you will have 90% chance to get at least one job offer?\n",

    "#### Problem 2, President Election Polls\n",
    "Half of the population supports the president (i.e., p=0.5). For a random sample of size 1000, what is the probability of having â‰¥550 in support of the president?\n",

    "1. Use binomial distribution\n",
